# EKIDEN

**HUGE WORK IN PROGRESS**

My goal for Ekiden is to create a feature complete (all NIPs implemented) relay server that is highly performant and easily deployable.

## WTF is Nostr?
"Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays"

[Nostr](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nostr) is an open-source network protocol that defines how messages are passed between clients and relays.
